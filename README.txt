Twitterslurp is a php/javascript tool for displaying a constantly-updating stream of Twitter searches on a website. Twitterslurp also provides graphs and analytics derived from the tweets.

Twitterslurp is licensed under the MIT/X11 license.

Twitterslurp has been used:
* as a tracking tool used to give rewards to members of a political action website for tweeting
* as a tracking tool for tweets for several conferences, including the Dutch PHP Conference and the Personal Democracy Forum
* to power a video wall of tweets at the Personal Democracy Forum


== Software Requirements ==

Twitterslurp requires PHP 5.2 (specifically for the json extension). It may work on PHP 5.1 with the json extension installed, but this has not been tested.

Twitterslurp uses jQuery and the flot jQuery extension for displaying graphs.

Twitterslurp also uses (but does not require) APC for caching graph data.
